Assignment 5: Using Agile Project Management to Implement a Complex Marketing Campaign System

Imagine you are the project manager for a critical project for an organization. The organization wants to implement a state of the art real-time marketing campaign system. This system has many components.

<ul>

 <li>First, it has to get data from its front-end systems via the middle-ware component.</li>

 <li>Second, it has its own database system that stores the shopping history, credit information, billing address and shipping address, and so on.</li>

 <li>Third, it has a marketing rules engine that needs to be customized for various campaigns.</li>

 <li>Finally, it has an analytical platform that leverages data warehouse and analytics tools, such as SAS to test marketing strategies and assess campaign effectiveness.</li>

</ul>

In addition, your company already has some stand-alone applications supporting marketing campaigns and analytics. Due to this project, your executives want IT to retire the legacy applications as part of the project. Although your executives plan to have this new system in production in twelve (12) to fourteen (14) months, they want to see the results as soon as possible, so they can enable more business capabilities, such as real-time decisions for up-selling and cross-selling. The executives also want to save costs by using offshore resources even though your organization does not currently have experience with this. Other troubles with the organization include problems controlling the scope of projects and inexperience to initiatives of this size. To further complicate the situation, you are aware that some of the business executives have had bad experiences with IT delivery in the past and you heard numerous complains about IT projects being late without meeting project expectations.
